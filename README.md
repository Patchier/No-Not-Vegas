# No, Not Vegas

September 9th, 2021 - Full Install: ~40GB.

## OVERVIEW

This ReadMe is designed to help you with installing and beginning your adventures in New Reno, alongside a few new quests.

## GOALS

-  Install and make minor configuration to Fallout: New Vegas.

-  Install and get started with the New Reno experience you deserve!

## SPECIFICATIONS

- This list does not have any specific MCM tweaks, but it DOES have an extra step during the installation phase. Be sure to follow ALL instructions.

## First off, you will need:

-   A clean, fresh, and LEGAL Steam installation of Fallout: New Vegas w/ all DLCs

-   50GB free to install the list itself

## Install Fallout: New Vegas

- This part is self-explanatory. You'll want to go to the installation of the game, and remove all files present in the install folder (For example, steamapps/common/Fallout New Vegas) AND the Documents folder (Documents/My Games/FalloutNV)

### Uninstalling the game

If you have the game installed under `C:\Program Files\`, `C:\Program Files (x86)\`, your Desktop, or your Documents folders, follow these steps to remove it.

#### Steam

1. Open **Steam** and go to your **Library**.
2. Find **Fallout: New Vegas** in the list.
3. Right-click on it and select **Manage** -> **Uninstall**.
4. Navigate to `Steam\steamapps\common\` and, if present, delete the **Fallout New Vegas** folder.

### Making a new Steam Library

If you already have a Steam library set up outside of any default Windows folder, skip this step.

A new Steam library needs to be set up to install the game on, as the default library is in a default Windows UAC-protected folder (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`).

1. Open **Steam** and select **Steam** -> **Settings** in the top left.
2. In the **Downloads** tab, select **Steam Library Folders**.
3. Select **Add Library Folder** and select a location outside of any default Windows folders.
   * For example, `C:\Games\Steam`.
4. Exit out of the settings when you are finished.

By default, Steam only allows one library per drive, but there is a workaround. If for example you already have the default Steam library at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`, but still want your game on your `C:\` drive, you will need to follow [these instructions](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide) to do so.

- While you're here, run the game once, and after the launcher has detected your graphics settings, you may close out of it. We just needed those initial INIs to be created. They will be superceded by the ones in my modlist.

Install No, Not Vegas via Wabbajack: 
----------------------------------------- 

1.  Download No, Not Vegas from the Wabbajack Gallery (you've probably already done this part): 

2.  After that, you will choose an installation folder (I recommend something like "D:/No, Not Vegas", substituting D: for any drive available.) This CANNOT be where Wabbajack.exe is located, nor your Fallout New Vegas folder.

3.  Downloads will auto-populate for you, but you can change that location if you so choose. 

4.  From there, just click the "play" button and let it do the rest. If you do not have Nexus Premium, you will have to follow along to the manual download prompts.

5. Once the list has finished installing, open the folder you installed it to, and double-click on ModOrganizer.exe

## Starting the game

Once you've finished installing the modlist, simply navigate to your installation folder for the modlist, open ModOrganizer.exe, and launch it via the New Vegas option, which should be selected for you. If not, simply choose it from the drop-down and click "run". 

## New Reno

- As of the writing of this section, Tales of New Reno is in the process of major updates. I will immediately be carrying these over once it is complete, but bugs are INCREDIBLY LIKELY! I've playtested this list for a few hours, and had no major issues, but I CANNOT guarantee you will not. Keep this in mind.
